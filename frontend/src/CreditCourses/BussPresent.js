                            How do effective presenters build credibility? <br/> <br/>

                            &nbsp;They communicate their credentials and experience to audience members as often as
                            possible. <br/>
                            &nbsp;They have fun while presenting and tell as many jokes as possible. <br/>
                            &nbsp;They closely monitoring audience members for their timeliness and enthusiasm. <br/>

                            Your presentation should balance logic and emotion. Which question can you ask to verify
                            that your presentation design is logical? <br/> <br/>

                            &nbsp;Does your tone, body language, and overall energy show a high level of interest and
                            enthusiasm for the topic? <br/>
                            &nbsp;<strong class="ans">Are your main points logically sequenced with smooth transitions

                            &nbsp;Do you maintain eye contact and lean toward the audience, showing interest and

                            &nbsp;Do you change your volume to get attention, either high or low? <br/>

                            presentation? <br/> <br/>

                            &nbsp;<strong class="ans">If you have the opportunity, you should consider talking to your

                            &nbsp;You should focus on your presentation design and not spend time interviewing the
                            audience.
                            Afterall, you know your content best. <br/>
                            &nbsp;If you have the opportunity interview your audience about their preference in
                            Powerpoint or
                            Prezi for your visuals. <br/>
                            &nbsp;If you have the opportunity ask your audience who is a presenter they have enjoyed in
                            the

                            &nbsp;<strong class="ans">Have ample amounts of caffeine and sugar before your presentation to increase your energy

                            &nbsp;Focus your energy outward and think about the needs of the audience. <br/>

                            &nbsp;Practice with your technology and have a backup plan. <br/>

                            In a popular scientific conference John presented his latest research. The audience was
                            surprised that he took the time to explain every acronym and statistical method. Why did
                            John take this approach? <br/> <br/>

                            &nbsp;John didn’t have any information on the audience makeup. He took an educated guess.
                            <br/>
                            &nbsp;John had not considered any difference in audience knowledge but he thought that would
                            be a
                            better approach because that was a successful approach in the past year’s conference. <br/>
                            &nbsp;John knew that professors and scientists from all over the world were attending and he
                            was
                            trying to accommodate the on English speakers. <br/>
                            &nbsp;<strong class="ans">John knew that young graduate students and family members were in attendance. He
                                assumed
                                that they didn’t have the same level of knowledge as most members of the audience.</strong> <br/>

                            What should you do when practicing the delivery of your presentation? <br/> <br/>

                            &nbsp;Include visuals in your mock practice run. <br/>
                            &nbsp;<strong class="ans">all of these answers</strong> <br/>
                            &nbsp;Practice being conversational while keeping your main points and transitions in order.
                            <br/>
                            &nbsp;Consider videotaping yourself to look for fillers or nervous movement. <br/>

                            A speaker with strong emotional appeal does all of the following, except: <br/> <br/>

                            &nbsp;Wears a sharp looking suit so that he can look very professional. <br/>
                            &nbsp;Uses strong intonation and conviction in his speaking. <br/>
                            &nbsp;Gestures large and changes his position on the speaking stage to match his message.
                            <br/>
                            &nbsp;Uses emotive and visual language. <br/>

                            Which choice best demonstrates effective eye contact during a presentation? <br/> <br/>

                            &nbsp;Focus your eyes on the floor three feet ahead or one foot above the people in the back
                            row
                            of your audience. <br/>
                            &nbsp;Look at unfriendly faces first to force them to engage in your presentation. <br/>
                            &nbsp;<strong class="ans">Hold eye contact for three seconds with as many people as you can to avoid looking
                                like a
                                lifeguard scanning the room.</strong> <br/>
                            &nbsp;Don’t consider the unique culture and surroundings of your audience. Eye contact is
                            always
                            positive. <br/>
