            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;1:&nbsp;Sustainability and Development is an interdisciplinary field of study and practice that seeks to build bridges between the natural, social and applied sciences and the humanities to address the challenges of the worldâ€™s most pressing problems. Rather than sustainable serving as a qualifier for development, Sustainability and Development places sustainability on an equal footing with development.<br /><br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>a: True</strong><br /></p>

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;1:&nbsp;When sustainability and development are placed on an equal footing:<br /><br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>f: We need to think more explicitly about trade-offs, co-benefits, and synergies between sustainability and development AND we need to attend to contributions from both social and ecological sciences to solve problems of sustainability and development.</strong><br /></p>

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;1:&nbsp;Ensuring the well-being of those living today without compromising the well-being of those in the future is a baseline definition of sustainability.<br /><br />

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;1:&nbsp;Sustainability Science is a fundamental framework to think about Sustainability and Development as a field of study. As a framework it is insufficient without interdisciplinarity (i.e. one discipline alone cannot sufficiently account for our most pressing problems) and a robust and interactive relationship between knowledge and practice. Which among the following are foundational foci for Sustainability Science:<br /><br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>f: All of the above</strong><br /></p>

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;1:&nbsp;A trade-off can be described as a situation when it is not possible to improve outcomes in one area without worsening outcomes in another area. Which of the following is NOT an example of a tradeoff:<br /><br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>d: Greater market share for higher profits.</strong><br /></p>

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;1:&nbsp;A co-benefit occurs when efforts to improve one area go hand-in-hand with another area. An example of this would be social assistance programs that reduce poverty and inequality while strengthening the climate resilience of recipient communities and households.<br /><br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>a: True</strong><br /></p>

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;1:&nbsp;We learn from our discussion of historical transitions "i.e. demography, energy, forestry, agricultural and nutritional" that societal transitions require:<br /><br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>d: All of the above</strong><br /></p>

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;1:&nbsp;Implementation science seeks to link research and practice to enable the use of research in decision-making and practice.<br /><br />

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;1:&nbsp;Outcomes that are positive in more than one dimension include which of the following:<br /><br />
