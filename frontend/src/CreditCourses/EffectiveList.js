                            You are speaking with a friend over the phone, and they tell you about something that has
                            been bothering them. Which action demonstrates that you are an empathetic listener? <br/><br/>

                            &nbsp;Walk in the person’s shoes with judgment. <br/>
                            &nbsp;Smile a lot while on the phone. <br/>

                            Which choice best describes attentive listening? <br/> <br/>

                            &nbsp;In her response, the listener shares her own experiences in an effort to be empathetic and
                            make the speaker feel at ease. <br/>
                            &nbsp;In her response, the listener gives advice, especially if she has more experience with the
                            situation than the speaker. <br/>
                            &nbsp;<strong class="ans">In her response, the listener clarifies her role, uses attentive nonverbals, honors silence,
                                paraphrases, and matches emotion with the speaker.</strong> <br/>
