            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;2:&nbsp;Your friend crosses in front of a red light, and a police officer notices. The officer stops to question you. Which statement is most likely true?<br /><br />

                &nbsp;In a rules-based culture, the officer will treat you, your friend, and all other citizens uniquely.<br />

                &nbsp;In a high context culture, people tend to communicate with detailed messages. In a low context culture, messages are minimal and implicit.<br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>In a high context culture, messages are communicated with fewer words and more nonverbals. In a low context culture, messages are communicated with explicit words.</strong><br />
                &nbsp;In a high context culture, people tend to speak more softly than in a low context culture.<br /></p>

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;4:&nbsp;Assume you come from a monochronic, direct, and low-power distance culture. How could you best start reaching out to and securing a new vendor in a culture very different from your own?<br /><br />

                &nbsp;Risk depends on the average age of a culturesâ€™ working population. The older the population, the more comfortable they will be with risk.<br />
                &nbsp;Risk is related to the number of relationships built in the workplace, and it tends to be higher in Mediterranean cultures.<br /></p>

                &nbsp;reminder emails, water cooler chats, and longer lunches<br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>agendas, procedure manuals, and tight time management meetings throughout the day</strong><br /></p>
