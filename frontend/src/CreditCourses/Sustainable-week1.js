                &nbsp;1:&nbsp;The Sustainable Development Goals "SDGs" are a framework that “recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.” <br /><br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>a: True</strong><br /></p>

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;2:&nbsp;The 17 SDGs are framed according to the principles and practices of Sustainable development. Which of the following statements accurately summarize the goals of Sustainable development?<br /><br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>e: All of the above</strong><br /></p>

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;3:&nbsp;In 2015, the United Nations, an intergovernmental organization, settled on 17 Sustainable Development Goals "SDGs" designed to be a “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all”. The 17 SDGs were:<br /><br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>f: negotiated among member states of the United Nations, civil society stakeholders and other groups but are not legally binding AND designed to be implemented and evaluated by each member state of the United Nations.</strong><br /></p>

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;4:&nbsp;Which one of the following answer choices is true?<br /><br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>e: The SDGs universally apply to all countries whereas the MDGs apply specifically to developing countries. AND the SDGs aim to address the three dimensions of sustainable development as conceptualized by the UN: economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. AND unlike the MDGs, the SDGs explicitly stress the importance of addressing climate change.</strong><br /></p>

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;5:&nbsp;There are 169 targets and 232 indicators associated with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The goals are ambitious, action-oriented and aspirational while the targets are specific, measurable and attainable. There should be a clear linkage between a goal and its targets. An indicator is used to measure the progress for achieving a specified target.

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>a: True</strong></p>

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;6:&nbsp;Sustainable Development Goal 5 "Gender Equality" seeks to “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls”. Which of the following is NOT a measurable indicator for achieving this goal?<br /><br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>g: “Ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life” AND “Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation”</strong><br /></p>

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;7:&nbsp;Given current projections, we are on a path towards achieving all 17 SDGs by 2030.<br /><br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>b: False</strong><br /></p>

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;8:&nbsp;Sustainability and Development<br /><br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>e: All of the above.</strong><br /></p>

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;9:&nbsp;Rather than sustainable serving as a qualifier for development, Sustainability and Development places sustainability on an equal footing with development.<br /><br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>a: True</strong><br /></p>

            <p className='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;10:&nbsp;When sustainability and development are placed on an equal footing, it forces us to think more sharply about the trade-offs, co-benefits and synergies between them.<br /><br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>a: True</strong><br /></p>
