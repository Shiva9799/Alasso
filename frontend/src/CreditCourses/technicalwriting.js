            <p class='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;1:&nbsp;What is the difference between a conceptual guide and a procedural guide?<br /><br />

                &nbsp;A conceptual guide explains why it is necessary to accomplish a task, but a procedural guide describes pitfalls.<br />
                &nbsp;A conceptual guide explains the order of steps, but a procedural guide lists the steps in no particular order.<br />
                &nbsp;A conceptual guide outlines steps to accomplish a task, but a procedural guide explains the main ideas of that task.<br />
                <strong class='ans'>&nbsp;A conceptual guide introduces main ideas, but a procedural guide outlines steps to accomplish a task.</strong><br /></p>

            <p class='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;2:&nbsp;Which of the following items best uses plain language to describe an idea?<br /><br />

                &nbsp;Lyophilize the sample until its mass becomes constant.<br />
                &nbsp;Remove as much water as possible from the sample by lyophilization.<br />
                &nbsp;Freeze dry the sample until no more water sublimes.<br />
                <strong class='ans'>&nbsp;Leave the sample in the lyophilizer until its mass does not change with time.</strong><br /></p>

            <p class='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;3:&nbsp;How are “Must” Quick Start Guides organized?<br /><br />

                &nbsp;They give the user options for how to proceed.<br />
                <strong class='ans'>&nbsp;They walk the user through a strict sequence to achieve a desired outcome.</strong><br />
                &nbsp;They are presented non-sequentially.<br />
                &nbsp;They include helpful visual aids.<br /></p>

            <p class='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;4:&nbsp;It can be helpful to base your Quick Start Guide on _.<br /><br />

                &nbsp;an online template<br />
                <strong class='ans'>&nbsp;the user manual</strong><br />
                &nbsp;previous Quick Start Guides you have made<br />
                &nbsp;your competitor’s Quick Start Guide<br /></p>

            <p class='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;5:&nbsp;The most important aspect of formatting to remember is that _.<br /><br />

                &nbsp;it should be conservative and decorative<br />
                &nbsp;it should be easy on the eye and consistent<br />
                <strong class='ans'>&nbsp;it should convey meaning and be consistent</strong><br />
                &nbsp;it should be decorative and flamboyant<br /></p>

            <p class='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;6:&nbsp;How should you address the user when you are writing a Quickstart guide?<br /><br />

                &nbsp;with the phrase “the user” throughout the guide<br />
                <strong class='ans'>&nbsp;with second-person pronouns or the imperative mood</strong><br />
                &nbsp;with a fictional user and giving that user a name<br />
                &nbsp;with third-person pronouns and the indicative mood<br /></p>

            <p class='cc-boxes'>&nbsp;7:&nbsp;How can you avoid including too many notes?<br /><br />

                &nbsp;by writing a glossary of terms<br />
                &nbsp;by including notes in an appendix<br />
                <strong class='ans'>&nbsp;by breaking up steps into smaller groups</strong><br />
                &nbsp;by using footnotes instead of notes in the text<br /></p>
